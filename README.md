# ArchKnitter

ArchKnitter is an IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin that helps developers visualize and understand their application's architecture. It uses annotations to mark architectural components and generates visualizations of your code's structure.

## The Idea

The main goal of ArchKnitter is to make software architecture visible and understandable. By using simple annotations in your code, you can:

- Mark architectural components (like Presenters, UseCases, Repositories)
- Define relationships between components
- Generate visual representations of your architecture
- Understand the structure of your codebase

## How It Works

1. **Mark Your Components**: Use annotations to identify architectural components in your code
2. **Analyze**: The plugin analyzes your codebase to understand the structure
3. **Visualize**: View an interactive representation of your architecture

## Example

```

## Current Status

ArchKnitter is currently in early development. We're focusing on:
- Basic architecture analysis
- Simple visualization
- Core annotation system
